#### Game Description & Game rules
UNO is one of the most famous card games in the world. It is popular because of its easy-to-learn rules. We are trying to build UNO game in C/C++ based on text. So that it can run by Linux and via SSH. In case you do not know what is Uno, there are 108 cards in the deck, generally divided by four colours: Red, Yellow, Green, Blue. For each colour, it contains one "0" card and two "1" through "9" cards. Other than normal cards, there are some function cards: two "Skip", "Reverse" and "Draw 2" cards for each colour. Finally, it consist of four "Wild" and four "Wild Draw 4". More in-depth function will be introduced in rules section.
